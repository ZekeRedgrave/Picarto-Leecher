# Picarto-Leecher
A python script would allow you to download all your favorite artist's video streaming in picarto. Similar like twitch-leecher but running on console application.

# How to use?
- There is two menu list in the application(merge and url)
- "url" is allows you to download the video streaming piece by piece or a fragment
- "merge" is allows you to concat all the video fragment into a single video file using ffmpeg

Don't forget to follow me on twitter for more updates.
Soon these console application will be turning this into a gui application coming soon.
